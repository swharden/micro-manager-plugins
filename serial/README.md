# Controlling BusPirate with ImageJ
I came across a last-minute need to have ImageJ produce a 5V TTL signal. I grabbed a [BusPirate](http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/Bus_Pirate), figured out [how to send it commands](http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/Bus_Pirate_101_tutorial) from the Windows command prompt (actually the powershell), then wrapped it up in batch scripts which can be called with [ImageJ's exec()](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/developer/macro/functions.html). From ImageJ, you can turn a TTL on and off by using macro commands `exec("busPirate_ON.bat")` and `exec("busPirate_OFF.bat")`
